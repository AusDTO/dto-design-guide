<p class="abstract">The core modules all services need.</p>

Start here with:

- typeface and styling for basic HTML elements including headings, links and lists
- how to use the UI&#8209;Kit grid to lay out content
- the UI&#8209;Kit palette and accessible pairings.

The DTA Design Guide shows how to use UI-Kit to build services. Start here in Foundations with the core modules. Then use [Components](/components/) to add building blocks. The [Patterns](/patterns/) section shows how to combine components to meet user needs.

We're working on the Templates section to show how to use component patterns to build common service pages.
