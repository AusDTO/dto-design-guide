### Guidance

UI Kit applies a maximum width to typographic elements that appear within the main content container. This maintains a readable line length.

A max-width of 38rem (about 70 characters) is applied to these elements:
- h1 - h5
- p
- li
- dl

<div class="callout">
If you'd like to include an element that spans across the maximum available space, apply the class `.content-full-width`.
</div>
