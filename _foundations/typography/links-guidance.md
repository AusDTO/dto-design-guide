    <ul>
      <li>Link to only what the user needs. Too many links can make content hard to read.</li>
      <li>Use keywords that the user will understand and describe the destination.</li>
      <li>Aim to add links in paragraphs, rather than lists at the end.</li>
      <li>Use 'see more' links at the end of <a href="/components/list-styles/index.html">list styles</a> to take the user to a index page of all items.</li>
      <li>Use placeholder styling (greyed out links) to show actions that a user can't currently take. Explain why the action isn't available and when it will be.</li>
      <li>Placeholder styling only works in <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags, not <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</li>
