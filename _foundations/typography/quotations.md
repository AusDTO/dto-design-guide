### Guidance
There are 2 ways of using quotes:

- **in-line quoting** using `q` element (adds quotation marks to either side of the in-line quotation)
- **block quotes** via `blockquote`:
 - standard block quote
 - editorial block quote (pull quote) with larger size text.

`blockquote` is a block-level element that can contain in-line elements. So they can nest:

- multiple paragraphs, lists, etc
- another `blockquote`
- the `footer` element to provide citations using `<cite>`.
