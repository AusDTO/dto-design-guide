If you are building your own features using the UI-Kitâ€™s SASS, please use the functional colour variables instead of the descriptive ones, eg use `$error-colour` for errors instead of `$red`. The functional colours are currently listed in the bottom half of the [SASS colour partial](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/blob/master/assets/sass/utils/_colours.scss).
