- All navigation must be keyboard accessible and include ARIA tags.
- Use the HTML `<nav>` element for controls and the given state classes to show which page the user is on.
- Use short navigation links. They don't have to be the full page title.
- Test with users to ensure the navigation hierarchy is not too long or too deep.
- Use the [correct colour contrast](section-colours.html#guide-colours-3-colour-contrast) for breadcrumbs and inline links.
