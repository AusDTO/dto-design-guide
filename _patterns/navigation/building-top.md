<p class="abstract">All navigation must be keyboard accessible and include <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria" rel="external">ARIA tags</a>.</p>
- Use the `<nav>` element for navigation controls.
- Use the given state classes to show which page the user is on.
- Use short navigation links. They don't have to be the full page title.
- Test with users to ensure the navigation hierarchy is not too long or too deep.
- Use the [correct colour contrast]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundations/colours/index.html#text-accessibility) for breadcrumbs and inline links.
