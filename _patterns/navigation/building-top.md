<p class="abstract">All navigation must be keyboard accessible and include ARIA tags.</p>
- Use the `<nav>` element for navigation controls.
- Use the given state classes to show which page the user is on.
- Use short navigation links. They don't have to be the full page title.
- Test with users to ensure the navigation hierarchy is not too long or too deep.
- Use the [correct colour contrast](/foundations/colours/index.html#text-accessibility) for breadcrumbs and inline links.
