<li>The framework provides a vertical navigation menu. The home page title is always at top, followed by up to 3 levels of navigation.</li>
<li>Small screens (up to `$tablet` breakpoint) will see the menu closed (unexpanded) by default.</li>
<li>Older browsers (IE8 and lower) and those without JavaScript will see an expanded menu. It will not be able to be closed.</li>
<li>Use active state to show where the user is. Use `class="is-active"` for each clicked menu item. Use  `class="is-active is-current"` for the current location.</li>
