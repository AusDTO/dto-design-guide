These are hidden visually by default but keyboard accessible.

Include skip links between the opening of the `<body>` and the page `<header>`.

<div class="callout">
  <p>To test,
    <a href="">click to move focus to this</a> then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to show:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Skip to main content</li>
    <li>Skip to section navigation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(The example space will be visually empty until the skip links receive focus.)</p>
</div>
