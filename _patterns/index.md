<p class="abstract">How to combine components to meet user needs.</p>

Guidance on:

The DTA Design Guide shows how to use UI-Kit to build services. Start in [Foundations](/foundations/) with the core modules. Then use [Components](/components/) to add building blocks. This section shows how to combine components in to Patterns that meet user needs.

We're working on the Templates section to show how to combine component patterns to build common service pages.
