<p class="abstract">Use special link blocks to help users find content elsewhere that will meet their needs.</p>

Groups of links span from 2 columns (`$mobile`) up to 4 columns (`$tablet` and `$desktop`).

You can use groups of links:

- in the header (eg listing popular links across the site)
- anywhere within an `article` (eg as a list of related topics).
