<p class="abstract">How to use the UI&#8209;Kit building blocks.</p>

Guidance on:
- form elements and controls
- styles for lists of links and other content
- accordions and status badges
- data tables.

The DTA Design Guide shows how to use UI-Kit to build services. Start in [Foundations](/foundations/) with the core modules. Then use the Components in this section to add building blocks. The [Patterns](/patterns/) section shows how to combine components to meet user needs.

We're working on the Templates section to show how to use component patterns to build common service pages.
