Use 1 button per page to build a strong call to action. Adding a second or third button forces users to make a choice. If choice is required use another kind of element eg radio button.

Use button text to describe what the button does &mdash; keep it short.

The button alignment in [forms](section-forms.html) should put the primary action button at the left edge, in the user's line of sight.

Creating buttons

Call buttons using:

- `<button>` element (for actions like submitting a form)
- the `role` property of `a` elements (eg an anchor link).

Do not apply styles to disabled buttons.
