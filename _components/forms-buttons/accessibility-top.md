### Labels

- All forms fields should have labels.
- Don't hide labels, unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary.
- Tell the user what they need to enter into the field. Label text should be short and direct.
- Avoid colons at the end of labels.
- Align labels above their fields. They should be associated with form fields using the `for` and `id` attribute.

### Optional & mandatory fields

Only ask for the information you absolutely need. Don't mark mandatory fields with asterisks.

If you have to ask for optional information mark the field labels with ‘(optional)’.
