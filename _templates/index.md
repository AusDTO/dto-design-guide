We are working on templates for common pages, such as:

- contact us
- media releases
- home/landing page
- generic content page.

The DTA Design Guide shows how to use UI-Kit to build services. Start in [Foundations](/foundations/) with the core modules. Then use [Components](/components/) to add building blocks. The [Patterns](/patterns/) section shows how to combine components to meet user needs.
