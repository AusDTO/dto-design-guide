UI-Kit needs to support all of our users, regardless of their device, web browser or other user agent.

Equal access to information about laws and government programs is a legal requirement under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/C2016C00763" rel="external">Disability Discrimination Act (1992)</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/blob/develop/BROWSER-SUPPORT.md" rel="external">Read the browser support document</a>.

We don’t list unsupported devices and browsers. We are aiming for a solid HTML mobile-first foundation that provides functional support for the browsers and devices of all of our users.

We have written <a href="https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/blob/develop/assets/sass/utils/_mixins.scss#L2" rel="external">a SASS mixin for conditional handling of Internet Explorer specific overrides</a>. Use this when extending the UI-Kit.
