<p class="abstract">Use UI&#8209;Kit to build consistent and responsive services that meet the user's needs.</p>

These principles build on the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/" rel="external">Digital Service Standard</a> and the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-principles/" rel="external">DTA design principles</a>.

1. The design is there to meet the user's need.
2. Use common designs and layouts that the user will understand.
3. Support access and functionality for the user's browsers and devices. UI-Kit aims to be WCAG2 AA compliant, and AAA where possible.
4. Build for mobile-first using responsive design methods.
5. Delight the user.
